    <h1>Welcome to Single Step!</h1>
    <p>When beginning a new endevour we here at Single Step have found that it is best not to get bogged down in 
        the details of logging metadata when keeping track of progress. To that end we have created a web app to track 
        many different goals at once with as little friction as possible.
    </p>
    <p>To start, make an account, log in, create some goals, and start tracking!</p>
